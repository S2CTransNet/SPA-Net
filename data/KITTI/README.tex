The point cloud data in this file are all from KITTI (https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/). By using PointNet++ to segment these point clouds, ten real vehicle point clouds are extracted. In order to realize the unified processing of point cloud, the number of points of each vehicle point cloud is adjusted to 2048 points by random up sampling method.
